RuboCop Defaults for Samvera Community

## To Use This

In your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'bixby'
```

In your `.rubocop.yml`:

```yaml
inherit_gem:
  bixby: bixby_default.yml
```

## Versioning & Dependencies

This project depends on `rubocop` and `rubocop-rspec`. It supports versions of those gems pessimistically. Beginning with release `1.0.0`, we will periodically add support for new versions of the dependencies and manage the included cops. When compatibility breaks, the major version of `bixby` will be bumped.

Our goal is to insulate downstream projects from breakage due to pre-1.0 version updates in `rubocop`.

## License

Bixby is available under [the Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE.md).

1. `bundle install`
1. Increase the version number in `bixby.gemspec`
1. Increase the same version number in `.github_changelog_generator`
